# Installation

The STH component provides 3 alternatives for its installation:

1. Cloning the Github repository
2. Using a RPM package
3. Automatic deployment using Docker

## Cloning the Github repository

To install the STH component cloning the Github repository, please follow the next steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Get into the directory where the STH repository has been cloned.
3. Install the Node.js modules and dependencies.

This is:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet.git
cd fiware-sth-comet/
npm install
```

The STH component server is ready to be started as a Node application.

## Using a RPM package

In the next sections we detail the steps to follow to install, update and remove the STH component using a RPM package.

### Package generation

**Prerequisites:** To generate the RPM package from the STH component sources it is needed to have the rpm build tools (`rpmbuild` executable), Node and the
npm utilities, as well as an Internet connection to download the required Node modules.

To generate the RPM package for the STH component, execute the following command from the root of the STH component:
```bash
./rpm/create-rpm.sh -v <version> -r <release>
```

If everything goes fine, a new RPM package will be created and stored in the following location: `./rpm/RPMS/x86_64/fiware-sth-comet-<version>-<release>.x86_64.rpm`.

Execute the next command to get additional information about the RPM package creation script:
```bash
./rpm/create-rpm.sh -h
```

### Installation, upgrade and removal

**Prerequisites:** Node is needed to install the generated STH component RPM package.

To install or upgrade the STH component, execute:
```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh fiware-sth-comet-<version>-<release>.x86_64.rpm
```

After the installation, the following files and directories are created:
```
/etc/init.d
└── sth

/etc/logrotate.d
└── logrotate-sth-daily

/var/log/sth

/var/run/sth

/opt/sth
├── conf
│   └── <empty> Here is where instances are configured
├── node_modules
│   └── <node modules directory structure and files>
├── package.json
└── src
    └── <STH SW files>
```

To remove a previous STH component installation, execute:
```bash
sudo rpm -e fiware-sth-comet
```

### Configuration

STH is able to start multiple instances using the [`sth`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/rpm/SOURCES/etc/init.d/sth) service script by adding and configuring certain files as detailed next.

To start multiple instances, one configuration file per instance has to be included in the `/opt/sth/conf` directory. It is important to note that the default installation includes preconfigured instances.

It is important to change the `STH_PORT` value included in the configuration files to a value not used by other STH instances/services. It is also a good practice to change the `LOG_FILE_NAME` value to avoid getting the logs from several instances mixed.

The [`sth`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/rpm/SOURCES/etc/init.d/sth) service script includes the following operations:

* **start**: if no `<instance>` (see below) is provided, the script starts an instance per configuration file found in the `/opt/sth/conf` directory matching the `sth_*.conf` template. If `<instance>` is provided, a configuration file named `sth_<instance>.conf` is searched in the `/opt/sth/conf` directory and the corresponding instance is started.
* **stop**: if no `<instance>` (see below) is  provided, the script stops all the instances by listing all pid files under `/var/run/sth` matching the pattern `sth_*.pid`. If `<instance>` is provided, the scripts stops the instance with the associated pid file `/var/run/sth/sth_<instance>.pid`
* **status**: The status operation shows information about one or more running instances
following the same procedure detailed in the `stop` operation.
* **restart**: The restart operation executes a `stop` operation followed by a `start` operation according to the procedure detailed in those operations.

```bash
# start
sudo /sbin/service sth start [<instance>]
# stop
sudo /sbin/service sth stop [<instance>]
# status
sudo /sbin/service sth status [<instance>]
# restart
sudo /sbin/service sth stop [<instance>]
```

An example [`sth_default.conf`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/rpm/EXAMPLES/sth_default.conf) file has been included in the component repository in Github  to guide the STH instance configuration.

Last but not least, the STH process (a `node` process) runs the as `sth` user.

## Automatic deployment using Docker

To ease the testing and deployment of the STH component, there also exists Docker images hosted at the [FIWARE Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/sth-comet/), including all the information needed to deploy and to try the STH component via the execution of a simple Docker command.

On the other hand a [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) and a [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) files have also been included in the component repository in Github to quickly and easily start your own instance of the STH component, even including the needed associated MongoDB instance where all the data will be stored.

To do it, follow the next steps once you have installed Docker in your machine:

1. Navigate to the path where the component repository was cloned.
2. Compose and run the STH component image
    * In foreground mode:
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
    ```
    * Or in detached mode:
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

There is also the possibility to build your own local Docker image of the STH component.

To do it, follow the next steps once you have installed Docker in your machine:

1. Navigate to the path where the component repository was cloned.
2. Launch a Docker build
    * Using the default NodeJS v0.10.42 version:
    ```bash
    sudo docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .
    ```
    * Using an alternative NodeJS version:
    ```bash
    sudo docker build --build-arg NODEJS_VERSION=v0.10.46 -f docker/Dockerfile .
    ```
