This directory includes a set of scripts which may make the developer's life much easier. Currently, it includes the following scripts:

* ```drop_database_mongo.sh```: Shell script which drops all the databases of certain MongoDB instance whose names start with the provided prefix.
To run it just execute: ```sh drop_database_mongo.sh database_prefix```, and all the databases of the local running MongoDB instance
will be dropped.
* ```performanceTestCheck.js```: Mongo shell script which checks the result of a notification performance test run against
certain STH instance. For further information about the performance tests, please visit the [Performance tests](../test/perfomance/README.md)
section of the repository. To run the helper function, just start the MongoDB shell (```mongo```), load the script (```load('performanceTestCheck.js')```)
and execute: ```assertEntriesPerCollection(expectedEntriesPerCollection)```. Obviously, the ```entriesPerCollection``` number will
depend on the parameters passed to the performance test run.
